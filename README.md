## How it works

- A C server
- CSS with Bulma
- Saves all data in memory
- User can create board with votes options.
- When the server needs the user to have identity it'll redirect him to set his username
- When the board votes changes it'll refresh automatically
- Users can edit boards
- Users can vote on cards
- Users that didn't vote yet are not allowed to show the votes results

## Running the server

Run the server script, it'll install the needed dependencies
```
make run
```

## Guidelines

- No login needed
- No persistent data
- No Javascript (one line to refresh board when updated)
- Minimal dependencies
